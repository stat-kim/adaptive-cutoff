# A Neural Network-Based Approach to Normality Testing for Dependent Data

This is the repository where we have stored the R code for our paper, "A Neural Network-Based Approach to Normality Testing for Dependent Data".

## File 1: `Data_simulating.R`
The `Data_simulating.R` file is a code script designed for generating the data required for our simulation study and real data application. 

## File 2: `Classifiers_adaptive_cutoff.R`
The `Data_simulating.R` file is a code script designed for training neural networks and linear classifiers and creating cutoff functions for testing a new data vector.
