# A Neural Network-Based Approach to Normality Testing for Dependent Data

This is the repository where we have stored the R code for our paper, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10422]('_A Neural Network-Based Approach to Normality Testing for Dependent Data_')

## File 1: `Data_simulating.R`
The `Data_simulating.R` file is a code script designed for generating the data required for our simulation study and real data application. 

## File 2: `Classifiers_adaptive_cutoff.R`
The `Classifiers_adaptive_cutoff.R` file is a code script designed for (1)training neural networks and linear classifiers and (2)creating cutoff functions for testing normality of a new data vector.  

## File 3: `Realdata_aggregation.R`

In File 1, File 2, and File 3, necessary comments have been included to assist users in comprehending the content. 

The CMIP6 data used for real data application can be downloaded from the following link: [https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6)
